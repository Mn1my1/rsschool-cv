## About me: 
I’m 27 years old design engineer from Ekaterinburg. My actual job is not as creative as I want, it’s more about mechanical analysis, which is so boring sometimes. That’s why I’m here. Want to learn new creativity skills and try to work in a different way. I chose front-end development, because I thought that it is the most creative field of programming.

## Skills and Proficiency:
• Python (basic knowledge)

• Algorithmization (including life)

• HTML (basic knowledge and one website as a coursework from first course of institute) 

•  Git

• Photo editors (Photoshop, Paint.net, Pixlr)
